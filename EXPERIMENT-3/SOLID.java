SOLID PRINCIPLES:

1. S: SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE

-STATES THAT EVERY CLASS MUST PERFORM A SINGLE FUNCTIONALITY.
-IMPLEMENTATION OF MULTIPLE-FUNCTIONALITIES IN A SINGLE 
 CLASS CAN MASHUP THE CODE.
- A CLASS SHOULD HAVE A SINGLE REASON TO CHANGE. 
 
EG: WE HAVE 
	CLASS BANK_SERVICE
	{

	PUBLIC DEPOSIT(AMOUNT, ACCOUNT_NO)
	{
		RETURN DEPOSIT_AMOUNT;
	}
	
	PUBLIC WITHDRAW(AMOUNT, ACCOUNT_NO)
	{
		RETURN WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT;
	}
	
	PUBLIC PRINT_PASSBOOK(ACCOUNT_NO)
	{
		//LOGIC TO UPDATE PASSBOOK INFO
	}
	
	PUBLIC GET_LOAN_INFO(LOAN_TYPE)
	{
		IF (LOAN_TYPE = "HOMELOAN")
		{
			//DO SOME LOGIC
		}
	
		IF (LOAN_TYPE = "PERSONAL")
		{
			//DO SOME LOGIC
		}
		
		IF (LOAN_TYPE = "CAR")
		{
			//DO SOME LOGIC
		}
	}
	
	PUBLIC SEND_OTP(METHODS)
	{
		IF (METHOD == "EMAIL")
		{
			//WRITE EMAIL API TO SEND THE OTP
		}
	}
}

--HERE IF YOU OBSERVE, 
THIS CLASS HAS MULTIPLE REASONS TO CHANGE:
FOR INSTANCE, YOU WANT TO HAVE GOLD LOAN, OR LET'S SAY YOU WANT 
HAVE A FUNCTIONALITY IN WHICH YOU WANT TO SEND THE OTP ON MOBILE 
NOT ON EMAIL -> IN THAT CASE WE HAVE TO SHIFT THE LOGIC AGAIN & AGAIN 
WHICH IS NOT GOOD.

- A CLASS SHOULD HAVE ONLY ONE FUNCTIONALITY TO PRESERVE ITS LOGIC.
- INSTEAD OF HAVING A SINGLE CLASS HERE FOR ALL FUNCTIONALITIES, WE CAN
  HAVE DIFFERENT CLASS / SERVICES(IN TERMS OF FULL-STACK APP) TO PERFORM 
  ITS OWN TASK.
  
  
---SEPERATE CLASSES--------
CLASS PRINTER_SERVICE 
{
	PUBLIC PRINT_PASSBOOK(ACCOUNT_NO)
	{
		//LOGIC TO UPDATE PASSBOOK INFO
	}
}

CLASS LOAN_SERVICE
{
	PUBLIC VOID GET_LOAN_INFO(STRING LOAN_TYPE)
	{
		IF (LOAN_TYPE = "HOMELOAN")
		{
			//DO SOME LOGIC
		}
	
		IF (LOAN_TYPE = "PERSONAL")
		{
			//DO SOME LOGIC
		}
		
		IF (LOAN_TYPE = "CAR")
		{
			//DO SOME LOGIC
		}
		IF (LOAN_TYPE = "GOLD")
		{
			//DO SOME LOGIC
		}
	}
}

CLASS NOTIFICATION_SERVICE 
{
	PUBLIC VOID SEND_OTP(STRING METHODS)
	{
		IF (METHOD == "EMAIL")
		{
			//WRITE EMAIL API TO SEND THE OTP
		}
		IF (METHOD == "MOBILE")
		{
			//WRITE MOBILE API TO SEND THE OTP - TULLIO MOBILE API 
		}
	}
}

-- THIS IS SINLE-RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------



























--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. OCP - OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE 
- IT STATES THAT ACCORDING TO NEW REQUIREMENTS THE MODULE SHOULD BE OPEN 
  FOR EXTENSION BUT CLOSED FOR MODIFICATION.
- WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXTEND A CLASS BEHAVIOUR WITHOUT MODIFYING IT. 

FOR EG: 
CLASS NOTIFICATION_SERVICE 
{
	PUBLIC VOID SEND_OTP(STRING METHODS)
	{
		IF (METHOD == "EMAIL")
		{
			//WRITE EMAIL API TO SEND THE OTP
		}
		IF (METHOD == "MOBILE")
		{
			//WRITE EMAIL API TO SEND THE OTP
		}
	}
}

THIS WAS THE CLASS FOR NOTIFICATION_SERVICE IN WHICH I WANT TO IMPLEMENT 
A SEND OTP METHOD ON WHATSAPP -> IN THIS CASE, ACCORDING TO OCP RULE:
	
	1. I SHOULD NOT WRITE ONE-MORE IF CONDITION IN THE SAME EXISTING
		NOTIFICATION_SERVICE CLASS, INSTEAD OF WHICH I WILL EXTEND THIS 
		CLASS TO WHATSAPP_SERVICE CLASS.
		(WHICH MEANS I AM ABLE TO EXTEND THE CODE FOR NOTIFICATION_SERVICE 
		CLASS TO OTHER OTP METHODS AS WELL AND PRESERVING THE OLD LOGIC AS 
		WELL)
		
	2. WE GENRALLY USE -> INTERFACES IN JAVA FOR THIS.
	

EG: 
	
PUBLIC INTERFACE NOTIFICATION_SERVICE 
{
	PUBLIC VOID SEND_OTP(STRING METHOD); //ABSTRACT METHOD
}

//NOW CREATE SEPERATE CLASSES TO EXTEND THE LOGIC OF NOTIFICATION_SERVICE

PUBLIC CLASS EMAIL_NOTIFICATION IMPLEMENTS NOTIFICATION_SERVICE
{
	PUBLIC VOID SEND_OTP(STRING METHOD)
	{
		//CALLING EMAIL NOTIFICATION API HERE.
	}
	
	//WE CAN ADD OTHER NOTIFICATIONS FOR EMAIL OVER HERE IN THIS CLASS. 
}

PUBLIC CLASS MOBILE_NOTIFICATION IMPLEMENTS NOTIFICATION_SERVICE
{
	PUBLIC VOID SEND_OTP(STRING METHOD)
	{
		//CALLING MOBILE NOTIFICATION API HERE.
	}
}

PUBLIC CLASS WHATSAPP_NOTIFICATION IMPLEMENTS NOTIFICATION_SERVICE
{
	PUBLIC VOID SEND_OTP(STRING METHOD)
	{
		//CALLING WHATSAPP NOTIFICATION API HERE.
	}
}

--IN FUTURE IT YOU WANT SOME OTHER NOTIFICATION SERVICE, THEN RATHER THAN
  MODIFYING THE EXISTING CODE, WE CAN EXTEND THAT ALREADY BUILT NOTIFICATION_SERVICE INTERFACE.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  3. LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE (LSP)
  - IT STATES THAT THE DERIVED CLASSES MUST BE COMPLETELY SUBSTITUTABLE FOR 
	THEIR BASE CLASSES. 
  - IN SIMPLE WORDS, IF CLASS A IS A SUBTYPE OF CLASS B, THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE
	TO REPLACE B WITH A WITHOUT INTERUPPTING THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PROGRAM. 
	
// WE HAVE A CLASS SOCIAL_MEDIA

PUBLIC ABSTRACT CLASS SOCIAL_MEDIA  --CLIENTS : WHATSAPP, INSTAGRAM ,FACEBOOK,
{
	//SUPPORTED BY: WHATSAPP, FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM
	PUBLIC ABSTRACT VOID CHAT_FUNCTIONALITY();

	
	//SUPPORTED BY: FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM
	PUBLIC ABSTRACT VOID PUBLISH_POST_FUNCTIONALITY(); --IS NOT FOR WHATSAPP 
	
	
	//SUPPORTED BY: WHATSAPP, FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM
	PUBLIC ABSTRACT VOID SEND_PHOTO_VIDEO_FUNCTIONALITY();
	
	
	//SUPPORTED BY: WHATSAPP, FACEBOOK
	PUBLIC ABSTRACT VOID GROUP_VIDEO_CALL_FUNCTIONALITY();	--INSTAGRAM 
}

--WE CAN HAVE MULTIPLE CLIENTS FOR THE SOCIAL_MEDIA CLASS LIKE
  WHATSAPP, FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM 
  
--LET'S LOOK FACEBOOK 

PUBLIC CLASS FACEBOOK EXTENDS SOCIAL_MEDIA 
{
	//AS THIS IS AN ABSTARCT CLASS -> MUST IMPLEMENT ALL METHODS 
	
	
	PUBLIC  VOID CHAT_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
	
	}
	
	
	PUBLIC  VOID PUBLISH_POST_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
	
	}
	
	
	PUBLIC  VOID SEND_PHOTO_VIDEO_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
	
	}
	
	PUBLIC  VOID GROUP_VIDEO_CALL_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
	
	}
}
--NOW IF YOU OBSERVE THAT FACEBOOK IS A SUBSTITUE OF SOCIAL-MEDIA,
ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY OF PARENT AND CHILD ARE SUBSTITUTABLE TO EACH OTHER.
HENCE, IT FOLLOWS LSP PRINCIPLE 


--NOW LET'S LOOK FOR WHATSAPP AS WELL 

PUBLIC CLASS WHATSAPP EXTENDS SOCIAL_MEDIA 
{	
	PUBLIC  VOID CHAT_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
	
	}
	
	//THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS NOT AVAILABLE TO WHATSAPP 
	PUBLIC  VOID PUBLISH_POST_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
		//IS NOT ACCESSBILE TO WHATSAPP 
	}
	
	
	PUBLIC  VOID SEND_PHOTO_VIDEO_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
	
	}
	
	PUBLIC  VOID GROUP_VIDEO_CALL_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
	
	}
}  
 
--HENCE, THIS CLASS DOES NOT FOLLOW LSP PRINCIPLE .


--SOLUTION: SEGREGATE THE FUNCTIONALITIES
WE CAN CREATE SOME SEPERATE INTERFACE HAVING INTERSECTION OF FUNCTIONALITIES.



PUBLIC INTERFACE SOCIAL_MEDIA // MAIN COMMON FUNCTIONALITIES 
{
	
	PUBLIC VOID CHAT_FUNCTIONALITY();
	
	
	PUBLIC VOID SEND_PHOTO_VIDEO_FUNCTIONALITY();
	  
}  

PUBLIC INTERFACE SOCIAL_POST_MEDIA //PUBLISH_POST FUNCTIONALITY
{
	
	PUBLIC VOID PUBLISH_POST_FUNCTIONALITY();
	  
} 

PUBLIC INTERFACE SOCIAL_GROUP_VIDEO_CALL //GROUP_VIDEO_CALL_FUNCTIONALITY
{
	
	PUBLIC VOID GROUP_VIDEO_CALL_FUNCTIONALITY();
	  
}

NOW CLIENTS CAN USE DESIRED FEATURES BASED UPON THEIR USE CASE  

FOR EG: INSTAGRAM 

PUBLIC CLASS INSTAGRAM IMPLEMENTS SOCIAL_MEDIA, SOCIAL_POST_MEDIA --LSP
{
	PUBLIC VOID CHAT_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
	
	}
	
	
	PUBLIC VOID SEND_PHOTO_VIDEO_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
	
	}
	
	
	PUBLIC VOID PUBLISH_POST_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
	
	}

}	


CLASS WHATSAPP IMPLEMENTS SOCIAL_MEDIA, SOCIAL_GROUP_VIDEO_CALL
{
	PUBLIC VOID CHAT_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
	}
	
	
	PUBLIC VOID SEND_PHOTO_VIDEO_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
		
	}
	
	PUBLIC VOID GROUP_VIDEO_CALL_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
		
	}
		
	
}



--2. WHATSAPP
PUBLIC CLASS INSTAGRAM IMPLEMENTS SOCIAL_MEDIA, SOCIAL_GROUP_VIDEO_CALL
{
	PUBLIC VOID CHAT_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
	
	}
	
	
	PUBLIC VOID SEND_PHOTO_VIDEO_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
	
	}
	
	
	PUBLIC VOID GROUP_VIDEO_CALL_FUNCTIONALITY()
	{
	
	}

}	
  
--THIS IS HOW WE CAN DESIGN LSP PRINCIPLE 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------




































----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE (ISP)
- IT STATES THAT THE LARGER INTERFACES SPLIT INTO SMALLER ONES. 
- BECAUSE THE IMPLEMENTATION CLASSES USE ONLY THE METHODS THAT ARE REQUIRED.
- WE SHOULD NOT FORCE THE CLIENT TO USE THE METHODS THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO
  USE. 
  
 - THE GOAL OF THE INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE IS SIMILAR 
   TO THE SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE + LSP . 
  

EG: A UPI_PAYMENT INTERFACE  --CLIENTS: GOOGLEPAY, PHONEPE, PAYTM 

PUBLIC INTERFACE UPI_PAYMENT
{
	PUBLIC VOID PAY_MONEY();
	
	PUBLIC VOID GET_SCRATCH_CARD();
	
	PUBLIC VOID GET_CASHBACK_AS_CREDIT_BALANCE();
}

--LET'S BUILD CLIENTS FOR THIS 

--1. GOOGLEPAY
PUBLIC CLASS GOOGLEPAY IMPLEMENTS UPI_PAYMENT
{
	PUBLIC VOID PAY_MONEY()
	{
	
	}
	
	PUBLIC VOID GET_SCRATCH_CARD()
	{
	
	}
	
	PUBLIC VOID GET_CASHBACK_AS_CREDIT_BALANCE()
	{
	
	}
}

--1. PAYTM
PUBLIC CLASS PAYTM IMPLEMENTS UPI_PAYMENT
{
	PUBLIC VOID PAY_MONEY()
	{
	
	}
	
	PUBLIC VOID GET_SCRATCH_CARD()
	{
	
	}
	
	//UN-NECESSARY OVERIDDEN METHOD OVER HERE - VIOLATION
	PUBLIC VOID GET_CASHBACK_AS_CREDIT_BALANCE()
	{
		//NO USE IN PAYTM OR PHONEPE
		//INJECT MY OWN CODE OVER HERE 
		// STEGNOGRAPHY -> BY WHICH WE EMBED MALICIOUS CODE BEHIND SOMETHING
	}
}


--SOLUTION: 
WE CAN CREATE A SEPERATE INTERFACE FOR THE GET_CASHBACK_AS_CREDIT_BALANCE


PUBLIC INTERFACE UPI_PAYMENT
{
	PUBLIC VOID PAY_MONEY();
	
	PUBLIC VOID GET_SCRATCH_CARD();
	
}

PUBLIC INTERFACE CASH_BACK_AS_CREDIT
{
	PUBLIC VOID GET_CASHBACK_AS_CREDIT_BALANCE();
}


--1. PAYTM 
PUBLIC CLASS PAYTM IMPLEMENTS UPI_PAYMENT
{
	PUBLIC VOID PAY_MONEY()
	{
	
	}
	
	PUBLIC VOID GET_SCRATCH_CARD()
	{
	
	}
}


PUBLIC CLASS GOOGLEPAY IMPLEMENTS UPI_PAYMENT,CASH_BACK_AS_CREDIT
{
	PUBLIC VOID PAY_MONEY()
	{
	
	}
	
	PUBLIC VOID GET_SCRATCH_CARD()
	{
	
	}
	
	@Override
	PUBLIC VOID GET_CASHBACK_AS_CREDIT_BALANCE()
	{
	
	}
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


















--------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. DEPENDECY INVERSION PRINCIPLE (DIP) 

- IT STATES THAT WE MUST USE ABSTRACTION (ABSTRACT CLASSES AND INTERFACES)
INSTEAD OF CONCRETE IMPLEMENTATIONS.
- HIGH LEVEL MODULES SHOULD NOT DEPEND ON THE LOW-LEVEL MODULE 
BUT BOTH SHOULD DEPEND UPON ABSTRACTION. 
- DIP PRINCPLE DEALS WITH RUN-TIME POLYMORPHISM.

EG: IMAGINE YOU WENT TO SHOPPING MALL AND PURCHASED SOME PROUCT 
	AND YOU GAVE YOUR CREDIT / DEBIT CARD TO CASHIER TO GET THE 
	PAYMENT DONE. 
	
	THE CASHIER DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE TYPE OF CARD OVER HERE, THIS 
	IS ABSTRACTION BTW CASHIER & YOU WITH THE JOB DONE AT RUN-TIME.

  
PUBLIC CLASS CREDIT_CARD
{
	PUBLIC VOID DO_TRANSACTION(DOUBLE AMT)
	{
		SYSTEM.OUT.PRINTLN("PAYMENT USING CREDIT CARD..!");
	}
}


PUBLIC CLASS DEBIT_CARD
{
	PUBLIC VOID DO_TRANSACTION(DOUBLE AMT)
	{
		SYSTEM.OUT.PRINTLN("PAYMENT USING DEBIT CARD..!");
	}
}

PUBLIC CLASS SHOPPING_MALL 
{
	
	PRIVATE DEBIT_CARD debitCard;
	
	
	PUBLIC SHOPPING_MALL(DEBIT_CARD debitCard)
	{
		THIS.debitCard = debitCard;
	}
	
	PUBLIC VOID DO_PURCHASE(DOUBLE AMOUNT)
	{
		debitCard.DO_TRANSACTION(AMOUNT);
	}
	
	PUBLIC STATIC VOID MAIN (STRING[] ARGS)
	{
		//SHOPPING_MALL shopping_mall = NEW SHOPPING_MALL();  //ERROR WE NEED DEBIT CARD INSTANCE FIRST HERE
		
		DEBIT_CARD debitCard = NEW DEBIT_CARD();
		SHOPPING_MALL shopping_mall = NEW SHOPPING_MALL(debitCard);
		
		shopping_mall.DO_PURCHASE(5000);
		
	}
}

PROBLEM IN THIS SCENARIO:
LET'S SAY MY DEBIT CARD HAS SOME PROBLEM AND I NEED TO PAY WITH CREDIT CARD 
AND IN OUR SHOPPING_MALL CLASS CODE WE NEED TO CHANGE THE IMPLEMENTATION. 

PUBLIC CLASS SHOPPING_MALL 
{
	
	PRIVATE CREDIT_CARD creditCard;
	
	PUBLIC SHOPPING_MALL(CREDIT_CARD creditCard)
	{
		THIS.creditCard = creditCard'
	}
	
	PUBLIC VOID DO_PURCHASE(DOUBLE AMOUNT)
	{
		debitCard.DO_TRANSACTION(AMOUNT);
	}
	
	PUBLIC STATIC VOID MAIN (STRING[] ARGS)
	{
		//SHOPPING_MALL shopping_mall = NEW SHOPPING_MALL();  //ERROR WE NEED DEBIT CARD INSTANCE FIRST HERE
		
		CREDIT_CARD creditCard = NEW CREDIT_CARD();
		SHOPPING_MALL shopping_mall = NEW SHOPPING_MALL(debitCard);
		
		shopping_mall.DO_PURCHASE(5000);	
	}
}

--IF YOU NOTICE, FOR THIS SMALL UPDATE, I NEED TO CHANGE EVERYTHING HERE.
-- VERY HIGH TIGHT COUPLING WITH CREDIT_CARD CLASS OR DEBIT_CARD CLASS.
-- NO ABSTRACTION HERE -> WHICH CARD I AM USING -> DIRECTLY VISIBLE





--SOLUTION: 
--USING RUN-TIME POLYMORPHISM -> USING INTERFACES 

PUBLIC INTERFACE BANK_CARD 
{
	PUBLIC VOID DO_TRANSACTION(DOUBLE AMT);
}

PUBLIC CLASS CREDIT_CARD IMPLEMENTS BANK_CARD
{
	PUBLIC VOID DO_TRANSACTION(DOUBLE AMT)
	{
		SYSTEM.OUT.PRINTLN("PAYMENT USING CREDIT CARD..!");
	}
}


PUBLIC CLASS DEBIT_CARD IMPLEMENTS BANK_CARD
{
	PUBLIC VOID DO_TRANSACTION(DOUBLE AMT)
	{
		SYSTEM.OUT.PRINTLN("PAYMENT USING DEBIT CARD..!");
	}
}


PUBLIC CLASS SHOPPING_MALL 
{
	
	PRIVATE BANK_CARD bankCard;
	
	PUBLIC SHOPPING_MALL(BANK_CARD bankCard)
	{
		THIS.bankCard = bankCard;
	}
	
	PUBLIC VOID DO_PURCHASE(DOUBLE AMOUNT)
	{
		bankCard.DO_TRANSACTION(AMOUNT);
	}
	
	PUBLIC STATIC VOID MAIN (STRING[] ARGS)
	{		
		BANK_CARD bankCard = NEW CREDIT_CARD(); //IF YOU WANT TO PAY WITH CREDIT CARD 
		BANK_CARD bankCard = NEW DEBIT_CARD(); //IF YOU WANT TO PAY WITH DEBIT CARD 
		SHOPPING_MALL shopping_mall = NEW SHOPPING_MALL(bankCard);
		
		shopping_mall.DO_PURCHASE(5000);	
	}
}



What is DIP?
1. Don't "Hard-Code" Connections: A big class (like ShoppingMall) should not be "married" to a small class (like DebitCard).

2. Use a "Middle-Man" (Interface): Instead of talking to a specific card, the Mall should talk to a General Idea of a card (like BankCard).

3. Inversion means "Flipping": Usually, the big class controls the small one. In DIP, we "flip" it so that both classes must follow the rules of the Interface.
